(defn eval-string
  "Evaluates string `s` as one or multiple Clojure expressions using the Small Clojure Interpreter.

  The map `opts` may contain the following:

  - `:bindings`: a map of symbols to values, e.g.: `{'x 1}`. The
  symbols will acts as names bound to the corresponding values in the
  expressions.

  - `:namespaces`: a map of symbols to namespaces, where a namespace
  is a map with symbols to values, e.g.: `{'foo.bar {'x 1}}`. These
  namespaces can be used with `require`.

  - `:allow`: a seqable of allowed symbols. All symbols, even those
  brought in via `:bindings` or `:namespaces` have to be explicitly
  enumerated.

  - `:deny`: a seqable of disallowed symbols, e.g.: `[loop quote
  recur]`.

  - `:realize-max`: integer; when provided, program may realize a
  maximum number of elements from sequences, e.g. `(vec (range))` will
  throw for any number. This also applies to sequences returned from
  the expression to the caller.

  - `:preset`: a pretermined set of options. Currently only
  `:termination-safe` is supported, which will set `:realize-max` to
  `100` and disallows the symbols `loop`, `recur` and `trampoline`.

  - `:features`: when provided a non-empty set of keywords, sci will process reader conditionals using these features (e.g. #{:bb})."
